# About the spectrogram and spectrogram analyzer.

In this experiment, I can give the input to the voice and in turn it gives the analyzing of the speech which we given through the input.
We can change the fft from 2 to 16hz and The frequency upto 1024hz.
The window size and the X-Axis and Y-Axis are mentioned as pixels per image (According to the frequency which is given) and y-axis shows the unit of the sound(deicbels).
By the input we can see there is variation in the tone with our speech and can find out the formant by taking the screenshot out of it.

##In the Spectrogram##,
The spectrogram takes the input as in of the audio file and later it gives us the graph of it.
Which is the speech-to-signal converter.

This experiment is mainly written in the JS , HTML and CSS.

The foreground of this experiment is that i took a lot of effort and found all types of codes which is available in the internet which i took it as a refernece and wrote it on my own.

By this I conclude that this experiment is done by me.

## The reference is from the "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API"

# How to run it:

To analyze with a file use the part-1.html to access it and change the file directory to the specified location where the audio file is located.
If u want to anlayze it dynamically, click on the untitled.html.
P.S you need to have microphone if u want to give input directly.

The experiment which is given is not exactly as same as of the given by my mentors.
I had tried my level best and present you with this experiment.

Thank you!!

If you have any issues, please let me know.

The test cases are in picture format which is in the code file directory.
